Need to model white paper shuffles
Link to paper:

Shuffle process A

-Cards begins by occupying spaces 1 through n, where n is the total number of cards.
-At each step, choose card randomly.
-Chosen card moves left one step, right one step, or stays in place, with probabilities 0.25, 0.25, and 0.5 respectively.
-The step size is calculated randomly.
-Chosen card moves to that slot and other cards slide to make room.
-This process is repeated for some specified number of steps.

```{r}
shuffle_process_a = function(new_deck, reps) {
  # Loop to randomly move individual cards
  for (rep in 1:reps) {
    # Pull in a new deck
    deck = new_deck
    
    # Pick a card and direction of travel
    card = sample(deck, 1)
    dir = sample(c(-1, 0, 1), 1, prob = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.5))
    
    # Initialize new location parameter
    new_loc = 0
    
    # Choose new location for chosen card
    if (dir == -1) {
      new_loc = sample(c(1:card - 1), 1)
    } else if (dir == 1) {
      new_loc = sample(c(card + 1:52), 1)
    }
    
    # Initialize blank deck
    new_deck = NULL
    
    # Generate deck using new card placement
    if (new_loc == 0) {
      new_deck = deck
    } else if (new_loc == 1) {
      new_deck = c(card, deck[!deck == card])
    } else if (new_loc == 52) {
      new_deck = c(deck[!deck == card], card)
    } else {
      new_deck = append(deck[!deck == card], card, after = new_loc - 1)
    }
  }
  return(new_deck)
}
# Check results
new_deck = shuffle_process_a(1:52, 100)
print(sum(new_deck) == sum(1:52))
print(new_deck)
```

Shuffle process B

-Cards begins by occupying spaces 1 through n, where n is the total number of cards.
-At each step, every card moves a random number of spaces to the right according to independent geometric random variables.
-Then every card moves a random number of spaces to the left according to the same distribution.
-When cards enter an occupied position, they are merged with the cards already there by a GSR shuffle.
-This is repeated for some specified number of steps, and then all piles are gathered together in order.

```{r}
shuffle_process_b = function(deck, n = 52) {
  shift = rgeom(n = n, prob = 0.25) - rgeom(n = n, prob = 0.25)
  deck = deck + shift
  
  # Initialize new_deck to store results
  new_deck = numeric(n)
  
  # Track the remaining indices of the deck
  remaining_indices = 1:n
  
  # Loop through each position in the new deck
  for (i in 1:n) {
    # Get the index of the smallest card in the remaining deck
    min_index = remaining_indices[which.min(deck[remaining_indices])]
    
    # Get the corresponding card and adjust it by the shift
    card = deck[min_index] - shift[min_index]
    
    # Store the adjusted card in the new_deck
    new_deck[i] = card
    
    # Remove the processed card from the remaining_indices
    remaining_indices = remaining_indices[remaining_indices != min_index]
  }
  return(new_deck)
}
# Check results
new_deck = shuffle_process_b(1:52, 52)
print(sum(new_deck) == sum(1:52))
print(new_deck)

```


Shuffle process C

-This is a generalization of Shuffling Process A into multiple dimensions.
-For some number of dimensions d, cards begin by occupying arbitrary vertices in a d-dimensional grid.
-At each step, choose a random card.
-With probability Â½, it remains at its current vertex.
-Otherwise, with equal probability it will move to any neighboring vertex.
-If a card moves to an occupied position, it is merged with the cards already there at a random position. 
-This is repeated for some specified number of steps, and then all piles are gathered together in lexicographical order.

```{r}
# Initialize the positions of cards randomly across a d-dimensional bounded grid
